  # Lisp-style lists

  Lists can be represented as nested 2-elements tuples.
  Empty list is conventionally represented as TVM `null` value (it can be obtained by calling [null()]).
  For example, tuple `(1, (2, (3, null)))` represents list `[1, 2, 3]`. Elements of a list can be of different types.

  # Slice primitives

  It is said that a primitive _loads_ some data,
  if it returns the data and the remainder of the slice
  (so it can also be used as [modifying method](https://ton.org/docs/#/func/statements?id=modifying-methods)).

  It is said that a primitive _preloads_ some data, if it returns only the data
  (it can be used as [non-modifying method](https://ton.org/docs/#/func/statements?id=non-modifying-methods)).

  Unless otherwise stated, loading and preloading primitives read the data from a prefix of the slice.

;;; Creates an output action which would reserve exactly amount nanotoncoins (if mode = 0), at most amount nanotoncoins (if mode = 2), or all but amount nanotoncoins (if mode = 1 or mode = 3), from the remaining balance of the account. It is roughly equivalent to creating an outbound message carrying amount nanotoncoins (or b − amount nanotoncoins, where b is the remaining balance) to oneself, so that the subsequent output actions would not be able to spend more money than the remainder. Bit +2 in mode means that the external action does not fail if the specified amount cannot be reserved; instead, all remaining balance is reserved. Bit +8 in mode means `amount <- -amount` before performing any further actions. Bit +4 in mode means that amount is increased by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase), including all extra currencies, before performing any other checks and actions. Currently, amount must be a non-negative integer, and mode must be in the range 0..15.

;;; Sends a raw message contained in msg, which should contain a correctly serialized object Message X, with the only exception that the source address is allowed to have dummy value addr_none (to be automatically replaced with the current smart contract address), and ihr_fee, fwd_fee, created_lt and created_at fields can have arbitrary values (to be rewritten with correct values during the action phase of the current transaction). Integer parameter mode contains the flags. Currently mode = 0 is used for ordinary messages; mode = 128 is used for messages that are to carry all the remaining balance of the current smart contract (instead of the value originally indicated in the message); mode = 64 is used for messages that carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message (if bit 0 is not set, the gas fees are deducted from this amount); mode' = mode + 1 means that the sender wants to pay transfer fees separately; mode' = mode + 2 means that any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase should be ignored. Finally, mode' = mode + 32 means that the current account must be destroyed if its resulting balance is zero. This flag is usually employed together with +128.
